											description={"Dr. Amit Sethi is an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay, and a Visiting Instructor of Pathology at UIC. His research group works on computer vision, deep learning, and medical image analysis. His current research is focused on extracting valuable information, such as for treatment planning, using deep learning on inexpensive medical modalities, such as whole slide pathology images of cancer tissues stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Technical challenges to solve these real-world problems include working with images that are very large in size but few in number, variable image quality and characteristics between hospitals, and the lack of reliable annotations. Before joining IIT Bombay, he worked as a faculty member of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at IIT Guwahati, and as a management consultant at ZS Associates' Chicago where he worked producing business insights using data analysis. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a focus on computer vision and machine learning, and a bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT Delhi."}

He is an active member of IITG.ai interested in probability theory. In his second year, he did his internship under Dr. Rohitash Chandra at UNSW where he worked on representation learning. In his work, they introduce matrix neural networks where matrices or higher order tensors are used as representations to process directly within the layers. They then use a probabilistic notion of memory capacity on both vector conventional and matrix recurrent networks for comparison."}

											description={"Dr. Monojit Choudhury is a Researcher in Microsoft Research Lab India since 2007. His research interests cut across the areas of Linguistics, Cognition and Computation. Currently, he is working on script and code-mixing, especially in social media and web search. Code-mixing or use of more than one languages in a single conversation or utterance is a phenomenon that is observed in all multilingual societies. Due to social media and online forums, code-mixing is now rampant on the Internet. He is interested in developing core NLP techniques for identifying and processing code-mixed text. He also works on various NLP and Information Retrieval techniques for Indian languages. In the past I have worked on computational musicology, language evolution, evolution of the structure of Web search queries and complex networks."}
